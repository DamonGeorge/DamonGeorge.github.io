							MINDecoding = Movement Intent Decoding
							<br>
							<br>
							This project is a large part of my Master's research and thesis at Oregon State University.

							<br>
							<br>
							From my NSF GRFP Research Proposal:
							<i>
								The objective of my research is to develop novel adaptive movement intent decoders that
								leverage
								(1) human movement models,
								(2) extensive prosthetic sensor data, and
								(3) human feedback
								in order to learn from the user over time,
								allowing naturalistic, fine-grained and intuitive control of prosthetic limbs.
							</i>

							<br>
							<br>
							This software application is comprised of a library of Deep Network-based Decoders, called
							MINDecoders,
							and the corresponding GUI, called The MINDecoding-Interface, that provides the functionality
							to
							collect EMG or EEG from real subjects, train decoders with that biological data,
							test those decoders either online with a real subject or offline with existing datasets,
							and analyze those tests using a variety of result metrics.

							<br>
							<br>
							Although the code is still private since I haven't submitted my first set of related
							papers,
							you can find the detailed (but in-progress) documentation
							<a class="link" href="https://damongeorge.github.io/MINDecoding-Interface/"

						This is a Python utility library that I've developed and improved upon
						while using it in many of my Python projects that contain a ton of configuration.
						This library provides two classes, Parameterized and ParameterizedInterface,
						that can be extended so that the attributes of a given Python class can
						be shared and updated using dictionaries.
						It also makes saving/loading objects to/from json quite simple.

						<br>
						<br>
						Not only is this library very useful in certain projects;
						it has also been a great learning experience for me.
						I used this project to learn unit testing and Github workflows for Python.
						If you check out the Github repo,
						you can see I've created a pretty slick workflow
						that checks formatting, lints, tests, reports the coverage to a github badge,
						and also updates the release version badge as well.

						<br>
						<br>
						Currently I'm using this project in my MINDecoding project (which is currently private).

						As a fun side project based upon my brother <a class="link"
							href="https://www.thechristiangeorge.com/" target="_blank">Christian</a>'s work,
						I created the Python3 AudioStretch program that matches the beats of a stored audio loop to
						a
						live audio input.

						<br>
						<br>
						To do this, I used python-sounddevice for audio I/O and py-soundfile for reading/writing
						audio
						files.
						And then I wrote my own Cython wrappers for c library rubberband for audio stretching and
						the
						BTrack library for real time beat detection.
						This was a great learning experience in Cython for me!
						I also developed my own custom Python CircularBuffer class to store live audio buffers
						efficiently.
						And finally I wrote the master program that parses audio files to create loops,
						and then stretches the loop to match the beats of either a live input or an mp3 input.

						<br>
						<br>
						Although this is a fairly complicated signal processing problem,
						the final program worked well in matching beats, even during tempo changes.
						All that's missing are some more detailed safety checks to ensure that the beat tracker
						doesn't
						skip beats.

							For my year long senior design project at Gonzaga,
							two fellow engineers and I designed, developed, and built the Smart Helmet.
							The Smart Helmet is a helmet for cyclists that uses vehicle-to-everything
							communication to communicated with nearby vehicles and provide collision warnings to the
							biker.
							<br>
							<br>
							For this project, my two teammates and I built the hardware for the helmet, including 3
							revision of PCBs,
							designed and wrote the core firmware in C on our ultra low power Apollo 2 Blue
							microcontroller,
							and also wrote a Java desktop Traffic Simulator which provides the user with an advanced GUI
							for generating and driving cars, which we used for testing the Smart Helmet. I focused on
							the
							core firmware, which uses FreeRTOS as its real time operating system. I designed and wrote
							the logic and
							advanced collision detection on the helmet and in the Traffic Simulator, and I also helped
							write part of
							the GUI for the Simulator.

					As emerging smart vehicle technologies enter our roadways, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
					will become essential for improving the safety of road users. However, as such technological
					advances are made in cars and trucks, which have ample power and space for advanced electronics,
					cyclists can easily be left behind. In this study, we attempt to incorporate cyclists in the growing
					V2X ecosystem by developing a prototype 'Smart Helmet'. This product broadcasts positional and
					inertial data about the cyclist to nearby cars using the predefined Dedicated Short Range
					Communications (DSRC) standard, and receives similar data from nearby cars in order to provide the
					cyclist with haptic and audible collision warnings from the helmet. We attempt to construct a custom
					printed circuit board for the system so that it can be easily incorporated into a bike helmet as a
					consumer product. Furthermore, we develop a traffic simulator program that can be easily used to
					test traffic scenarios with the product. Simulation results show that even with the limited
					processing power available, this product can adequately detect harmful collisions. Limited usability
					testing shows that the haptic and audible warnings could function well in a consumer product.
					However, the technologies involved, such as the V2X communication and advanced GPS, are still
					immature, and creating effective yet unobtrusive audio warnings will require much testing. Overall,
					this study proves that this V2X system could greatly increase cyclist safety and possibly become a
					common feature on roadways in the next decade as smart vehicle technologies continue to mature.

							During my last semester at Gonzaga as an undergraduate,

							I wrote this in Java, using Swing for the simple interface.
							The program allows the user to play against the AI.
							At the end of the class, all the teams competed in a tournament
							to determine the best AI, and mine won 1st!
							<br>
							<br>
							This AI uses best first search with alpha-beta pruning to search the state space.
							Each move by the AI was required to complete within ten seconds, allowing this AI
							to search about 8-10 steps ahead in the game. The search uses an advanced heuristic
							value function that uses 8 different characteristics of the board to determine the
							value of the board. These characteristics include the score, the number of moves available,
							the number of corners taken or available, and the number of stable and unstable tokens.
							The AI also uses Zobrist Hashing to store all calculated heuristics in a hash table
							to increase the efficiency of the program.
