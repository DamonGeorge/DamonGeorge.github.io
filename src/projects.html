							For my year long senior design project at Gonzaga,
							two fellow engineers and I designed, developed, and built the Smart Helmet.
							The Smart Helmet is a helmet for cyclists that uses vehicle-to-everything
							communication to communicated with nearby vehicles and provide collision warnings to the
							biker.
							<br>
							<br>
							For this project, my two teammates and I built the hardware for the helmet, including 3
							revision of PCBs,
							designed and wrote the core firmware in C on our ultra low power Apollo 2 Blue
							microcontroller,
							and also wrote a Java desktop Traffic Simulator which provides the user with an advanced GUI
							for generating and driving cars, which we used for testing the Smart Helmet. I focused on
							the
							core firmware, which uses FreeRTOS as its real time operating system. I designed and wrote
							the logic and
							advanced collision detection on the helmet and in the Traffic Simulator, and I also helped
							write part of
							the GUI for the Simulator.

					As emerging smart vehicle technologies enter our roadways, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication
					will become essential for improving the safety of road users. However, as such technological
					advances are made in cars and trucks, which have ample power and space for advanced electronics,
					cyclists can easily be left behind. In this study, we attempt to incorporate cyclists in the growing
					V2X ecosystem by developing a prototype 'Smart Helmet'. This product broadcasts positional and
					inertial data about the cyclist to nearby cars using the predefined Dedicated Short Range
					Communications (DSRC) standard, and receives similar data from nearby cars in order to provide the
					cyclist with haptic and audible collision warnings from the helmet. We attempt to construct a custom
					printed circuit board for the system so that it can be easily incorporated into a bike helmet as a
					consumer product. Furthermore, we develop a traffic simulator program that can be easily used to
					test traffic scenarios with the product. Simulation results show that even with the limited
					processing power available, this product can adequately detect harmful collisions. Limited usability
					testing shows that the haptic and audible warnings could function well in a consumer product.
					However, the technologies involved, such as the V2X communication and advanced GPS, are still
					immature, and creating effective yet unobtrusive audio warnings will require much testing. Overall,
					this study proves that this V2X system could greatly increase cyclist safety and possibly become a
					common feature on roadways in the next decade as smart vehicle technologies continue to mature.

						As a Software Development Intern at
						<a class="link" href="https://www.openskysoftware.com" target="_blank">Open Sky Software,
							Inc.</a>,
						I spent multiple summer upgrading their flagship inventory tracking product,
						<a class="link" href="https://www.skywareinventory.com" target="_blank">Skyware Inventory</a>.

						<br /><br />
						As a full stack Java web developer, I used the Spring Framework, along with Hibernate and
						Thymeleaf,
						to completely redesign the entire application. I designed and coded an advanced transaction
						manager
						in Java and MySQL that tracks inventory through time across multiple items, users, and
						locations.
						I incorporated industry standard reporting, such as LIFO, FIFO, and AVG costing. I also
						developed
						advanced front-end Javascript to handle editable tables with custom fields, ajax autocomplete,
						and flexible form validation.
						<br /><br />
						This version 2.0 of Skyware Inventory was just released earlier this spring!
						It is gorgeous, especially the new mobile version (which I designed and programmed almost
						completely by myself).

						During my last semester at Gonzaga as an undergraduate,
						my partner and I built an Othello playing AI for my Artificial Intelligence elective.
						I wrote this in Java, using Swing for the simple interface.
						The program allows the user to play against the AI.
						At the end of the class, all the teams competed in a tournament
						to determine the best AI, and mine won 1st!
						<br>
						<br>
						This AI uses best first search with alpha-beta pruning to search the state space.
						Each move by the AI was required to complete within ten seconds, allowing this AI
						to search about 8-10 steps ahead in the game. The search uses an advanced heuristic
						value function that uses 8 different characteristics of the board to determine the
						value of the board. These characteristics include the score, the number of moves available,
						the number of corners taken or available, and the number of stable and unstable tokens.
						The AI also uses Zobrist Hashing to store all calculated heuristics in a hash table
						to increase the efficiency of the program.

						As the final project for my senior year Digital Design class at Gonzaga,
						a fellow student and I successfully designed and programmed two FPGA dev boards in VHDL
						to use high speed Ethernet communication. The communication allowed the two dev boards
						to turn each other's LEDs on in different patterns using their switches.
						For this project we used Intel's Ethernet IP in Quartus to program the Ethernet hardware
						onto the FPGA.
						<br><br>
						This was one of my hardest projects at Gonzaga University. We were the only team in the class
						to successfully commplete the project according the original specifications. Completing the
						project
						required a ton of extra hours before the deadline(most of which was spent reading the Ethernet
						Hardware specifications),
						but it was definitely worth it when we were able to show off our working design to the class.

			<h2>Association Rule Mining</h2>

					This was the final project for my Parallel and Cloud Computing Elective.
					This is a Java Hadoop MapReduce program to mine the confidence of
					association rules that we ran on AWS. These association rules were parsed
					from large input files of concept identification codes. On
					the AWS EMR clusters, the execution time of the program was tested for different cluster sizes, for
					different amounts of input files, and using both the Hadoop file system and the Amazon S3 file
					system.

			<h2>Zoolander</h2>

					This final project for my Database Management class at Gonzaga
					is a Java command line interface that allows the user to interact

					This project was designed to incorporate many advanced SQL queries,
					such as joins, groups, aggregates, and subqueries. This program was written
					using the Spring Shell, which provides a very nice CLI.
